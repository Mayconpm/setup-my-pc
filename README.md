# setup-my-pc
Easy installation of things on the fresh pc (or not)

# Notes
- **My Env on Ubuntu** is a _Command Line Tool_ that makes easier to set up and to install some softwares.
- Limit to my tools that I use every day (feel free to bifurcate and adapt to your interests)
- Tested only on distribution based on Ubuntu

# Installing

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jonaselan/setup-my-pc.git

```
